The Stream API provides you with a very useful ability to stream (aka iterate) over a Collection of elements while simultaneously
processing these elements.

You can think of it the same way you would iterate over a Collection using a forEach loop. The Stream API simply implements the
iteration process for us. In addition, while streaming (iterating), you can process the Collection of elements in any number of ways.
The Stream API is built with extensive support for lambda expressions and method references.
