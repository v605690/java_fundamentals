For each POJO you created to complete the previous Airplane exercise, please change all the instance Methods in each
class to "private". Then, create getter and setter methods (for each instance variable) in each class you created for
the airplane exercise. Also, create a toString() method in each POJO. Once complete, demonstrate getting and setting
those Methods from the class in which you composed the Airplane object, as well as invoking their toString() methods.

Added instance Methods, private, getter and setter with the toString()
