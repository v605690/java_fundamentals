EntryPoint

Add the Scanner
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("What game would you like to play?")
System.out.println("Enter 1 for BlackJack, 2 for 5 Card Draw, 3 for ....");

int userChoice = scanner.nextInt();

    if (userChoice == 1) {
        Create BlackJackGame blackJackGame = new BlackJackGame(); -> AE
        blackJackGame.play(); -> AE
    } else if (userChoice == 2) {
     // create an object of the 5 card draw poker game play
  }
}

In BlackJackGame, extends to Game -> AE

setName("BlackJack");
setBasicRules("The player closet to 21 without going over 21 wins");

In Game, create name and basicRules instance variables and getter/setter methods

CardPlayer computer = new CardPlayer("Computer, 10000); -> AE
CardPlayer user = new CardPlayer();
CardPlayer will need a constructor

private String name;
private int stackValue;

Creating two or more constructors, or methods, with the same name and return
type, but different parameters

    initializeNewUser();
}
