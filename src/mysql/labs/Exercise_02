*  MySQL Exercise 2:
*
*   Let's get creative :)
*
*   Please create a new database to manage air travel. You can have some fun with this.
*
*   At a minimum, we want to be able to track:
*       - Flights
*       - Planes
*       - Locations/Destinations
*       - Airlines
*       - Passengers
*       - Tickets
*
*   Take some time to think through this. Pulling out a pen and paper and drawing a basic diagram of the tables and
*   associations is always a great idea. See this link for inspiration: https://images.megapixl.com/1682/16827854.jpg
*
*   After you've designed the database on paper, you can also feel free to explore tools like https://dbdiagram.io/d
*   to create fancy diagrams (and nice SQL exports). You can also explore the EER Diagram Tool within MySQLWorkbench.
*
*   Next, create the schema, create the tables, create all the primary keys and all appropriate foreign keys, and
*   populate the database with a enough information to make it interesting.
*
*   In the next exercise, we'll dig into querying this database.
